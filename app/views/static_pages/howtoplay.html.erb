						        In general, the concept of information markets is to provide a mechanism for players to "put their money where their mouth is" over a future event. 
								If the market proves efficient and provides the right incentives, then the theory 
								argues that the collective bets of "the crowd" will be a more intelligent and 
								accurate prognosticator of future events than individual "know it all" experts.

		        				The PolicyOracle is an information market.
								Your goal as a player is to estimate which will be the potential outcome of a future event. Each future event is represented as a question.
								Predictions are made by buying virtual shares of the outcomes you think are going to boom, and selling them when you think these outcomes are going to touch ground.
	            				Your goal is to foresee trends ahead of the crowd: to invest in the outcomes that 
	            				have low possibilities relative to their potential. If, over time, 
	            				your predictions have greater possibilities than other players' predictions, your fantasy fortune will grow.
	            				As a player, you contribute to the collective "wisdom of crowds" as the marketplace 
	            				as a whole converges on a common vision of the future of the events.

For a trader's perspective, PolicyOracle is always the buyer and seller of shares, depending on the case, without any limit to the quantity of the shares. The main guidelines and principles of PolicyOracle's design arise from research by Prof. Robin Hanson at George Mason University.
